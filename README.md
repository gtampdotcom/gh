GTA2 Game Hunter is an application designed to make finding GTA2 multiplayer opponents easier. GTA2 Game Hunter enhances GTA2's existing multiplayer features by adding a central chat lobby, automatically writing the settings to the registry, managing a server list, updating maps, ensuring everyone has the same files and launching GTA2.

It's coded in Visual Basic 6.0.  The language may be obsolete, commerical and abandoned but I still update this project a few times a year.
