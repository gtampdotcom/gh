GTA2 Game Hunter is an application designed to make finding GTA2 multiplayer opponents easier. GTA2 Game Hunter enhances GTA2's existing multiplayer features by adding a central chat lobby, automatically writing the settings to the registry, managing a server list, updating maps, ensuring everyone has the same files and launching GTA2.

It's coded in VB6 (Visual Basic 6.0).  The language is obsolete, commercial and abandoned but this project is still updated sometimes.
